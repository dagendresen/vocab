# Processes used by other standards organizations

## W3C

From the [World Wide Web Consortium Process Document (1 August 2014)](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/):

### Consensus (Section 3.3)
"Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public)."

The W3C Process Document provides a detailed process for assessing consensus and managing dissent. "A group SHOULD only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock."

### Documents
W3C produces several kinds of documents. The most important is a "**technical report**" whose purpose is to standardize Web technology. A technical report that has completed the W3C standards process is called a "**Recommendation**".  A "**Team Submission**" is an informative document produced by a W3C Team but is not part of the technical report development process. Groups may also produce W3C Notes. A **Note** documents information that is not part of a technical specification (e.g. use cases or best practices). It also may be used to clarify the status of abandoned work.

### Groups (Section 6)
There are two kinds of W3C groups that contribute to the development of Recommendations. An **Interest Group** brings together people who want to exchange ideas and evaluate potential Web technologies. A **Working Group** produces deliverables, including Recommendation Track technical reports and software. 

### Technical Report Development Process (Section 7)

1. A Working Group creates one or more **Working Drafts** to refine the document that satisfies their charter.
2. After a review suggests that a Working Draft has met the requirements to become a standard, the draft is published as a **Candidate Recommendation**.  
3. The Candidate Recommendation receives feedback from the entire W3C membership, while the Working Group formally collects implementation experience to demonstrate that the specification works.  
4. A **Proposed Recommendation** finalizes the review of the W3C membership and is assessed by the Director.
5. If the director determines that the member review supports advancement to a standard, the W3C publishes the document as a **Recommendation**.  The director may also decline to advance the document, to require additional work by the Working Group, or push the specification to a lower maturity level.

### Players in the Technical Report development process (Section 2)

**Members** are organizations that have joined the W3C and that provide representatives to participate on the Advisory Committee and to participate in Working and Interest Groups.

The **W3C Team** provides technical leadership and manages W3C Activies.  It includes the Director, Chair, Chief Operating Officer, paid staff, unpaid interns, and Fellows.  Fellows are individuals whose salary is paid by a Member organization.

The **Advisory Committee** provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy and management. It has no decision-making authority.

The **Technical Architecture Group**'s scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture.  It documents and builds consensus around principles of Web architecture. It resolves issues about Web architecture brought to it. It coordinates cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside the W3C.  The TAG is a permanent part of the W3C. Three members are appointed by the W3C Team.  Five members are elected by the Advisory Committee. The ninth member is the W3C Director.  The TAG observes the standard W3C consensus process, but may vote if consensus cannot be obtained and a timely decision is required. See the [TAG Charter](http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-tag-charter.html) for details. 

A **Working Group** consists of Member representatives, invited experts, and Team representatives. An **Interest Group** has the same types of members, plus public participants. To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are small (typically <15 people) and are experts in the area. Working and Interest Groups have Charters that define the group's mission, scope, duration, and deliverables. The Group has a Chair who is appointed by the Director. A group may have task forces to carry out assignments for the group. Group members who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the charter may be removed from Good Standing in the group.  

Working Groups have a "heartbeat" requirement to ensure that the group moves forward and is publicly accountable. The working group must update its technical report draft at least every three months. 

Working Groups and Interest Groups have a specified duration.  A group may be closed if the Director determines that there are insufficient resources to go forward or if the deliverable is produced ahead of schedule. If a Working Group is closed, the W3C publishes any unfinished specifications on the Recommendation track as  a "Working Group Note".

### Modifying a W3C Recommendation (Section 7.7)
Working groups track errors on an "errata page" that is linked from the Recommendation.  

There are several classes of revisions to a Recommendation:

1. A Recommendation can be republished if a revision involves non-textual changes (e.g. changing to a different version of HTML) 
2. Editorial changes do not require a technical review. In this case, the Recommendation drops back to the Proposed Recommendation stage.
2. Substantive changes that do not introduce new features move the Recommendation back to the Candidate Recommendation stage.
3. Substantive changes that introduce new features require starting at the beginning of the process with a new First Public Working Draft.

### Rescinding a W3C Recommendation (Section 7.9)

A W3C Recommendation can be rescinded. This may happen if it contains many errors that conflict with a later version or if burdensome patent claims affect implementers and cannot be resolved.
