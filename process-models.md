# Processes used by other standards organizations

## W3C

From the [World Wide Web Consortium Process Document (1 August 2014)](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/):

### Consensus (Section 3.3)
"Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public)."

The W3C Process Document provides a detailed process for assessing consensus and managing dissent. "A group SHOULD only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock."

### Documents
W3C produces several kinds of documents. The most important is a "**technical report**" whose purpose is to standardize Web technology. A technical report that has completed the W3C standards process is called a "**Recommendation**".  A "**Team Submission**" is an informative document produced by a W3C Team but is not part of the technical report development process. Groups may also produce W3C Notes. A **Note** documents information that is not part of a technical specification (e.g. use cases or best practices). It also may be used to clarify the status of abandoned work.

### Groups (Section 6)
There are two kinds of W3C groups that contribute to the development of Recommendations. An **Interest Group** brings together people who want to exchange ideas and evaluate potential Web technologies. A **Working Group** produces deliverables, including Recommendation Track technical reports and software. 

### Technical Report Development Process (Section 7)

1. A Working Group creates one or more **Working Drafts** to refine the document that satisfies their charter.
2. After a review suggests that a Working Draft has met the requirements to become a standard, the draft is published as a **Candidate Recommendation**.  
3. The Candidate Recommendation receives feedback from the entire W3C membership, while the Working Group formally collects implementation experience to demonstrate that the specification works.  
4. A **Proposed Recommendation** finalizes the review of the W3C membership and is assessed by the Director.
5. If the director determines that the member review supports advancement to a standard, the W3C publishes the document as a **Recommendation**.  The director may also decline to advance the document, to require additional work by the Working Group, or push the specification to a lower maturity level.

### Players in the Technical Report development process (Section 2)

**Members** are organizations that have joined the W3C and that provide representatives to participate on the Advisory Committee and to participate in Working and Interest Groups.

The **W3C Team** provides technical leadership and manages W3C Activies.  It includes the Director, Chair, Chief Operating Officer, paid staff, unpaid interns, and Fellows.  Fellows are individuals whose salary is paid by a Member organization.

The **Advisory Committee** provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy and management. It has no decision-making authority.

The **Technical Architecture Group**'s scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture.  It documents and builds consensus around principles of Web architecture. It resolves issues about Web architecture brought to it. It coordinates cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside the W3C.  The TAG is a permanent part of the W3C. Three members are appointed by the W3C Team.  Five members are elected by the Advisory Committee. The ninth member is the W3C Director.  The TAG observes the standard W3C consensus process, but may vote if consensus cannot be obtained and a timely decision is required. See the [TAG Charter](http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-tag-charter.html) for details. 

A **Working Group** consists of Member representatives, invited experts, and Team representatives. An **Interest Group** has the same types of members, plus public participants. To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are small (typically <15 people) and are experts in the area. Working and Interest Groups have Charters that define the group's mission, scope, duration, and deliverables. The Group has a Chair who is appointed by the Director. A group may have task forces to carry out assignments for the group. Group members who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the charter may be removed from Good Standing in the group.  

Working Groups have a "heartbeat" requirement to ensure that the group moves forward and is publicly accountable. The working group must update its technical report draft at least every three months. 

Working Groups and Interest Groups have a specified duration.  A group may be closed if the Director determines that there are insufficient resources to go forward or if the deliverable is produced ahead of schedule. If a Working Group is closed, the W3C publishes any unfinished specifications on the Recommendation track as  a "Working Group Note".

### Modifying a W3C Recommendation (Section 7.7)
Working groups track errors on an "errata page" that is linked from the Recommendation.  

There are several classes of revisions to a Recommendation:

1. A Recommendation can be republished if a revision involves non-textual changes (e.g. changing to a different version of HTML) 
2. Editorial changes do not require a technical review. In this case, the Recommendation drops back to the Proposed Recommendation stage.
2. Substantive changes that do not introduce new features move the Recommendation back to the Candidate Recommendation stage.
3. Substantive changes that introduce new features require starting at the beginning of the process with a new First Public Working Draft.

### Rescinding a W3C Recommendation (Section 7.9)

A W3C Recommendation can be rescinded. This may happen if it contains many errors that conflict with a later version or if burdensome patent claims affect implementers and cannot be resolved.

## Internet Standards of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

From [The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3 (RFC 2026, October 1996)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026).  See also [The IETF Process: an Informal Guide](https://www.ietf.org/about/process-docs.html).

> The Internet Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society that is organized and managed on behalf of the Internet community by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). ...
> 
> The Internet Standards Process described in this document is concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are used in or by the Internet...
> 
> In general, an Internet Standard is a specification that is stable and well-understood, is technically competent, has multiple,   independent, and interoperable implementations with substantial operational experience, enjoys significant public support, and is recognizably useful in some or all parts of the Internet.

### Organizations related to Internet Standards

[Internet Society (ISOC)](http://www.internetsociety.org/) is "global cause-driven organization governed by a diverse Board of Trustees that is dedicated to ensuring that the Internet stays open, transparent and defined by you."  Its trustees are appointed or elected by its Chapters, Organization members, and the IETF. The ISOC promotes the Internet.

[Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/).  The goal of the IETF is "to make the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet."  The IETF commits to an open process, technical competence, rough consensus, and a basis in real-world experience in implementing its specifications.  "There is no formal membership in the IETF and participation is open to all. Participation is by individual technical contributors rather than by formal representatives of organizations." [(IETF Working Group Guidelines and Practices)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2418#page-2) IETF Area Directors manage areas of focus (e.g. security-related technology) and may be assisted by an advisory group.

[Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)](https://www.ietf.org/iesg/). The IETF Area Directors along with the IETF Chair form the IESG. The IESG "is responsible for technical management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process. ... The IESG is directly responsible for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the Internet "standards track," including final approval of specifications as Internet Standards."

[Internet Architecture Board (IAB)](https://www.iab.org/). The IAB is a committee of the IETF responsible for oversight of the Internet architecture and the Internet Standards process, including appeals. It is responsible for editorial management of the RFC document series. It advises the ISOC Board of Trustees and Officers. It is comprised of twelve members selected by the IETF Nominations Committee, the IETF Chair, and several ex-officio positions.

### Documents

A **Request For Comments (RFC)** is an archival document in the official publication channel for Internet standards documents. RFCs include two important document types: Internet Standard (STD) and Best Current Practices (BCP).  **Internet Standards** are generally related to technical specifications required for communication across interconnected networks. **Best Current Practices** "define and ratify the community's best current thinking on a statement of principle or on what is believed to be the best way to perform some operations or IETF process function." BCPs are subject to the same set of procedures as standards track documents. There are also informational RDFs that are not subject to the rules for Internet standardization. 

### IETF workflow

A [Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5434) may occur at which an issue is discussed, and a problem is well-understood and scoped.  The meeting may result in the formation of a Working Group (WG) with a specific charter.

A [Working Group (WG)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2418) has a charter that is negotiated between a prospective working group Chair and the relevant Area Director, and approved by the IESG.  The Charter specifies the objectives and approach of the WG and enumerates milestones and  a timeframe for completion. 

The WG is led by a chair and has a document editor.  WGs are autonomous and determine the details of their own operation. The core rule for operation is that acceptance or agreement is achieved via working group 'rough consensus'."

After the tasks of a WG are completed, the group is disbanded. If the WG produces a standard, it often becomes dormant with its mailing list available to review the work as it moves toward Standard status.

If it becomes evident that a WG can't complete its work, the Area Director (in consultation with the WG) can: recharter, choose a new Chair, or disband the group.

The Document Editor "is responsible for ensuring that the contents of the document accurately reflect the decisions that have been made by the working group."

A Design Team is a sub-group that develops a proposal to solve a particular problem.

An [Internet-Draft (I-D)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2418#section-7.2) is a working document prepared in advance of a WG work session. Internet Drafts have no official standards status whatsoever.

Mature standards documents pass through two levels: Proposed Standard and Internet Standard (a third level - Draft Standard - was eliminated in [RFC 6410](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6410)) 

A [**Proposed Standard**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4.1.1) "is generally stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable.  However, further experience might result in a change or even retraction of the specification before it advances." A Proposed Standard "should have no known technical omissions with respect to the requirements placed upon it" and must remain at that level for at least six months.  

"An **Internet Standard** is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the   specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community." The IESG issues an IETF-wide "Last Call" of at least four weeks, then confirms the advancement to the Internet Standard level.  The [following criteria](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6410) apply:

1. There are at least two successful, independent interoperating implementations. 
2. There are no significant errata that would prevent interoperability with deployed specifications.
3. There are no unused features that greatly increase implementation complexity.
4. If patented, two implementations must have successfully used the licensing process.

**Best Community Practices (BCPs)** follow a process similar to that of Internet Standards:

1. Submit to IESG for review.
2. Last-Call on IETF Announce mailing list.
3. The IESG makes a final determination of whether to approve the action.

However, there are not two levels of maturity and once approved, the BCP is complete.

## Revising a Standard (RFC 2026 Section 6.3)

"A new version of an established Internet Standard must progress through the full Internet standardization process as if it were a completely new specification.  Once the new version has reached the Standard level, it will usually replace the previous version, which will be moved to Historic status. ... the relationship between the previous and the new versions must be explicitly stated in the text of the new version ..." 

## Retiring a Standard (RFC 2026 Section 6.4)

"As the technology changes and matures, it is possible for a new Standard specification to be so clearly superior technically that one or more existing standards track specifications for the same function should be retired.  In this case, or when it is felt for some other reason that an existing standards track specification should be retired, the IESG shall approve a change of status of the old specification(s) to Historic.  This recommendation shall be issued with the same Last-Call and notification procedures used for any other standards action."
