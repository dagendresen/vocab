# Terms from the DCAT Vocabulary are used to link various components of vocabularies.  I'm not sure if this is 
# appropriate (i.e. should an owl:Ontology also be typed as a dcat:Dataset ?
# In some cases using terms from the VOAF (Vocabulary of a Friend) specification might be better, but it has no particular standing 
# as far as I can tell.  For example typing a vocabulary as voaf:Vocabulary might be more descriptive than dcat:Dataset
# See http://lov.okfn.org/vocommons/voaf/

# This is part of the description of the Darwin Core standard itself.
# Currently the "permanent URL" of the standard only dereferences to a human-readable landing page for the standard.
# Eventually, it should dereference for semantic clients that request RDF to some RDF/XML- or RDF/turtle-formatted document containing triples like these:
