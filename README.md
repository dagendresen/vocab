## Background

Here are some key documents that form crucial background for our discussions:

* [Report of the TDWG Vocabulary Management Task Group](gbif_TDWG_Vocabulary_Management_Task_Group_en_v1.0.pdf) (2013-09-20). Permanent URL: [http://www.gbif.org/resource/80862](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80862). This document contains a summary of the Darwin Core (DwC) Namespace Policy in section 2.5, discusses how the Policy has worked in practice in section 2.5.3, and lists disadvantages of the Policy as it is currently implemented in section 2.5.4. It provides recommendations regarding adoption of the DwC Namespace Policy as a general practice in section 2.6.2.

* [Term Change Policy section of the Darwin Core Namespace Policy](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/index.htm#classesofchanges). Permanent URL: [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/). Section 3 of the DwC Namespace Policy outlines the Term Change Policy that governs the way that changes are made to terms in the DwC vocabulary. It does not discuss how changes should be made to other (non-normative) parts of the standard, such as descriptive guides.  

* [Draft TDWG Standards Documentation Specification](tdwg-stds-spec.pdf) (2007-11-05). Permanent URL: [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/147/](http://www.tdwg.org/standards/147/). This draft standard has never been ratified.  Nevertheless, it has provided guidance for the documentation of TDWG Standards in lieu of other guidelines. A key deficiency of this document is that it discusses only human-readable documents and does not specify how machine-readable documents should be documented. The document defines in Section 3 a hierarchy of document types (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) for the purpose of indicating what is normative and what is part of a standard. These designations have been widely misunderstood. There is also lack of clarity about the meaning of Section 8, which declares that standards cannot be changed in any substantive way.
